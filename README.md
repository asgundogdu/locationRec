## Motivation:

While the procession of transportation industry in the last hundred years enabled more travelling options to the people, it wasn't until just half a decade ago that the egression of social media platforms, shared thriftiness and GPS equipped mobile phones enabled these digital footprints of human mobility to be available publicly to the entire world. In this new world of shared economy, travelling cost per person has reduced due to which more and more people are moving from one region to another leaving behind their digital trails on social media sites. Although it might be still unclear about how continuing our online existence is going to affect the future of the human race, one thing is for certain that all this data that we are producing every day, exemplifies an inexhaustible resource which can be utilized for innumerous scientific studies.

The geo-location part of travel check-ins allows researchers to concentrate their focus on regions like populated cities.More than half of the population of the entire world resides in them. However, these cities aren't studied just because a lot of people live in them, but also because they have a rich history of development and growth, which lures many travelers and tourists from all over the world.

In this era of social networking sites, people's behavior online could help us have an idea about their tastes and preferences. Social check-ins, which store geo-tagged information about users, can be utilized by researchers and businesses to investigate these preferences and improve their services. In this project, we utilize the travel check-in data and use data-based visualizations to explore, assess and evaluate multiple SVD algorithms for the purposes of identifying anomalies, generating trust and providing the best recommendation for cities to visit in the USA.
