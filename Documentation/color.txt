 Color scale tools

Hi all,

 

I recently did another look through of tools for helping you create good color scales for your visualizations. Please please please make sure to follow recommended practices with your color scales in the projects! 

 

Get it right in black and white: Make sure lightness corresponds to the quantitative value encoded and that it scales linearly, both for sequential and diverging scales.

 

Lightness constancy: Make sure that categorical colors have the same lightness values even with different hues so that some don't pop more than others.
